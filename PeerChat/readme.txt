Node.java defines the class Node which can be a client as well as a server.
All nodes can join and leave the network. In terms of join, a node need to go through a node called bootstrap. Nodes can also communicate with each other, and multithread server is used by each node. A node also has a routing table and can find nearest node by searching the routing table.
